Dear Comrades,

After more than {years_in_microsoft} years working at Microsoft,
and the only company I worked for in my life,
it is with mixed feelings that I announce that my last day at Microsoft is tomorrow.

Starting on Monday, I will be pursuing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join {new_opportunity}.

I wanted to thank each of you for the positive impact on my professional growth.

I am hoping that our paths cross once again.

Thank you and warm regards,
James Liao
